# Multi-Touch Demo with Pointer Chooser

#Overview
A multi-touch application that tracks multiple touch points and draws
circles to indicate where they are when they're pressed, moved around and
lifted off the screen.


## Stretch Goals
Allows a group of users to each place a finger on the phone, waits for some
number of fingers to be held down consistently for some period of time, then
randomly choose one finger and highlights where it's touching on the screen.

#Screenshots
**NOTE:** Android Studio wouldn't recognize my phone to run application there. Nor would Vysor application.
Screenshots were taken with my phone camera so I could capture multitouch using my mouse.
